Requirements:

Top requirement: According to the "reviewed by", "reported by", "signed off by", "tested by" and "fix rate (fix / commit)" of each developer, use classification decision tree to predict the bug rate (bug / commit) of developers

Req1: Each developer's data shall be accurately captured and saved in a file.
	Req1.1 The names of developers should be obtained and wrote into a csv file.
	Req1.2 The tags of developers shall be obtained
		Req1.2.1Each developer's "reviewed by" "reported by" "signed off by" "tested by" and "fix rate (fix / commit)" shall be obtained.
		Req1.2.2 Data should be saved to another CSV file.

Req2: Data shall be preprocessed
	Req2.1Data shall be cleaned
		Req2.1.1The developers with less than 50 commits should be abandoned.
		Req2.1.2 Meaningless data shall be deleted.
			Req2.1.2.1 The NaN shall be deleted.
			Req2.1.2.2 Data with wrong developer name shall be deleted.

	Req2.2 The fix rate(fix / commit) and bug rate(bug / commit) should be calculated.

	Req2.2 Developers should be devided into 2 classes.

Req3: Classification decision tree shall be established accurately.
	Req3.1 Data shall be divided into training sets and test sets.

			Req3.3.2.1 Grid search may be used.

Req4: The model shall be evaluated correctly.
	Req4.1 ROC curve should be established correctly.
		Req4.1.1 False positive rate shall be taken as X-axis.
		Req4.1.2 The true positive rate shall be the Y-axis.
	Req4.2 AUC area should be calculated correctly
	Req4.3 Metrics such as precision, recall, accurcy... should be used.
