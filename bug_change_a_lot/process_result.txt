In order to verify the hypothesis of "bugs change a lot, fixes change less", our team adopted two methods.

The first method is to find the average value of random change, bug change and fix change. We added the value of lines added and lines removed as changes of a commit and calculated the average change of bugs, fixes and random commits. By directly comparing these three values, we can intuitively come to the conclusion that we can judge the hypothesis is true.

The second method is to use linear regression. First, we used multiple linear expression. The theoretical basis is to use linear regression to show the correlation between lines added, lines removed and files changed and bug/fix. We assume that if the commit is a bug, then its y value would be 1; otherwise, y value would be 0. Besides, we used one-dimensional linear regressionï¼Œthe assumption of y value is same as the value in multiple linear regression. We use the sum of the number of lines added and lines removed as x value, and use the number of lines added, line removed and file changed separately as value for the multiple one. Then we calculate the R^2 to judge the correlation between two variables. In the end, we came to about 17% and 15%, respectively, which means the hypothesis can be verified. The disadvantage of linear regression method is that it defaults to linear relationship, but the linear expression used is just a kind of speculation and it can't fit the nonlinear relation highly, so it causes limitations.
